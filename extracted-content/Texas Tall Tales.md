## Summary

Sweet Scarlett's Texas Red GrapefruitTexas Tall TalesSaddle up for some Texas-sized tall tales starring the sweetest cowgirl this side of the Rio Grande and her juicy, ruby-red grapefruit. View fullsize Once there was a texas cowgirl...that need only be described with one word: sweet. Legend has it her sweetness could charm the horns off a bull, or stop a bandit in his tracks. Though the story may change, one thing never will – there’s never been anyone, or anything, sweeter than Sweet Scarlett. Except maybe her Texas Red Grapefruit. View fullsize Some years ago...there was talk of a tornado so big it had hail the size of grapefruits. Everyone from here to Sweetwater had their stirrups in a twist. And wouldn’t you know it? That Texas-sized twister touched down right in front of Scarlett’s orchards. Now, Scarlett had a way with words, but when she had her steel-string, she could make mountains move. And by golly, she pulled out her guitar and started strummin’ The Yellow Rose of Texas, plucking those strings ’til her fingers started to darn near bleed. Then spur of the moment, that terrible tornado ran off like a hound dog with its tail between its legs. And what did that sweet Scarlett do? She gave a tip of her hat and blew that Texas twister a sweet kiss goodbye. “My goodness maybe it’s true things are really bigger in Texas. Thank God Scarlett had her steal string with her that fateful day. You can sing to me any time Scarlett.” — Edward Johnson, Facebook Comment View fullsize Once upon a Texas morning...we woke up to a trembler so big, it shook the ground like a statewide hoedown. The whole town was bewildered, but not Sweet Scarlett. She knew somethin’ was up—stampede! She threw on her lucky boots, grabbed her trusty rope, and sure enough, there was a herd of the biggest mustangs this great state has ever seen. They were 30 hands high with legs like live oaks and big bright eyes the size of grapefruits. With lasso in hand, Scarlett roped in one of those humongous horses. The power of his giant legs flung her up into the air, and scout’s honor, she landed right on his back. Within seconds of her sweet “Whoa!” the stampede slowed to steady. Sweet Scarlett kept the whole valley out of harm’s way that day, and kept that massive mustang, too. His name is Red. “Good stories, especially now that we live in Texas!!! 😍” — Susana Lazzari-Herbert, Facebook Commenter View fullsize One day, gosh darn it...Sweet Scarlett woke up to find that the red-hot sun hadn’t made it past the treetops. Perplexed, she called out to the sun, “Hey there, big fella. You’re lookin’ more blue than red today.” To which the sun replied, “Don’t you worry Miss Scarlett, it’s nothin’ a good rest can’t fix.” Knowing that a sunless sky would make most ranchers madder than a hornet trapped in an old tin can, Scarlett picked one of her biggest Texas Red grapefruits and hucked it high into the sky. The grapefruit soared into the air, landing right in the sun’s normal sittin’ spot. All day long it shone, and nobody was the wiser. In fact, legend has it that to this day there’s never been a more beautiful ruby red sunset. The next morning, the sun was up and at ’em right in time for the rooster’s crow and bellowed down to Scarlett, “Thanks for savin’ the day, darlin’. I guess you really are as sweet as they say.” View fullsize It’s safe to say...that Texas has had its share of rabble-rousers. Perhaps the most unbelievable of them all were the Billy Brothers–two no-good outlaws who, about fifty miles north of Sweetwater, commandeered a locomotive and headed south for the Texas-Mexico border. The train was racing faster than a dog at dinnertime toward the Rio Grande when the brothers heard a fast gallop coming up alongside the steam engine. It was Sweet Scarlett, on her giant mustang, Red. Scarlett jumped on board and came face to face with the highwaymen. “Show us what you’re packin’, little lady,” they demanded, pointing to her satchel. “Take a gander,” she said, opening the bag to reveal grapefruits that glowed like gold. The brothers were so mesmerized that by the time they looked up, the train had stopped, and the sheriff was haulin’ them away. After that sweet encounter, some say, those outlaws walked a line straighter than a fence post.
