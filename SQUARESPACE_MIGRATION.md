# Squarespace Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate your "Not Linked" project pages from Squarespace to your new portfolio site.

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Setup**: Ensure your `.env.local` file contains:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ncefkmwkjyidchoprhth.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Getting Your Squarespace URLs

Since Squarespace "Not Linked" pages aren't publicly accessible, you'll need to provide the URLs manually:

### Option 1: From Squarespace Admin
1. Log into your Squarespace admin panel
2. Go to Pages â†’ Not Linked
3. Copy the URLs of pages you want to migrate
4. URLs should look like: `https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project-name`

### Option 2: From Your Sitemap
1. Visit: `https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/sitemap.xml`
2. Look for pages that aren't linked in your main navigation
3. Copy those URLs

## Running the Migration

### Method 1: Using the Helper Script
```bash
./scripts/run-migration.sh \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project1 \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project2 \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project3
```

### Method 2: Using npm script
```bash
npm run migrate-squarespace \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project1 \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project2 \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project3
```

### Method 3: Direct execution
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/migrate-squarespace.ts \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project1 \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/project2
```

## What Gets Migrated

### Content Extraction
- **Title**: From page heading or title tag
- **Images**: All images from the page (hero + additional)
- **Text Content**: All text content from the page
- **STAR Sections**: Attempts to parse Problem, Objective, Actions, Results, Lessons if structured content exists

### Database Fields
- `title`: Extracted from page
- `badgeType`: Set to "UX Design"
- `summary`: Main content or "Content migrated from Squarespace - see STAR sections below"
- `heroImage`: First large image from the page
- `isVisible`: `false` (hidden by default)
- `urlSlug`: Preserved from Squarespace URL
- `problem`, `objective`, `actions`, `results`, `lessons`: Parsed STAR content (if found)
- `sortOrder`: Based on migration order
- `metrics`: Empty array

### Image Handling
- Downloads all images to `temp/squarespace-images/[project-slug]/`
- Uploads to Supabase Storage: `site_images/migrated-projects/[project-slug]/`
- Updates image references in content

## Authentication

The migration tool uses password "kevin" to access your password-protected Squarespace site. If you've changed this password, update it in `scripts/migrate-squarespace.ts`.

## Migration Report

After migration, you'll get:
- Console output with success/failure status
- `migration-report.json` file with detailed results
- List of successfully migrated projects
- List of failed migrations with error reasons

## Post-Migration Steps

1. **Review Results**: Check the migration report
2. **Test Projects**: Visit the admin panel to see migrated projects
3. **Update Content**: Improve STAR sections and content organization
4. **Set Visibility**: Change `isVisible` to `true` for projects you want to show
5. **Clean Up**: Delete `temp/squarespace-images/` folder when done

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed
- Verify the password is still "kevin"
- Check if Squarespace site is still password-protected
- Try accessing the site manually with the password

### Image Upload Failed
- Check Supabase Storage permissions
- Verify `site_images` bucket exists
- Ensure you have upload permissions

### Content Parsing Issues
- Some pages may not parse perfectly
- Manual review and editing may be needed
- STAR sections may need reorganization

### Database Errors
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify database schema matches expected structure
- Ensure you have write permissions

## Example Migration

```bash
# Migrate three specific projects
npm run migrate-squarespace \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/fintech-redesign \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/healthcare-app \
  https://kevin-laronda.squarespace.com/enterprise-dashboard
```

This will:
1. Authenticate with Squarespace using password "kevin"
2. Extract content from each page
3. Download and upload images to Supabase
4. Create project entries in your database
5. Generate a detailed migration report

## Notes

- All migrated projects are hidden by default (`isVisible: false`)
- Original Squarespace URL slugs are preserved
- Images are organized in separate folders for easy management
- The migration tool creates backups of all extracted data
- You can re-run migration for individual pages if needed
