# Admin Authentication Setup Guide

Your portfolio site now has a secure authentication system for the admin panel! üîê

## What's New?

- **Login Page**: Accessible at `/login`
- **Protected Admin Panel**: `/admin` route now requires authentication
- **User Management**: Logout button and user info displayed in admin panel
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Shift+A` (or `Cmd+Shift+A`) still works and will redirect to login if not authenticated

## Creating Your Admin Account

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Authentication

1. Open your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ncefkmwkjyidchoprhth
2. Click on **Authentication** in the left sidebar
3. Click on **Users** tab

### Step 2: Add a New User

1. Click the **"Add user"** button in the top right
2. Choose **"Create new user"**
3. Enter your email address (e.g., `kevin@kevinlaronda.com`)

5. Click **"Create user"**

### Step 3: Verify Email (Optional)

If you want to enable email verification:

For now, you can skip this and just create the user directly.
