  'I''m a strategic problem-solver who turns messy, ambiguous challenges into clear, meaningful experiences. With roots in creative marketing and a background in skateboarding, I''ve learned to see unconventional paths and execute with precision.

Over the years, I''ve evolved from creative director to UX strategist, developing a knack for identifying broken experiences and redesigning them into solutions customers love. I thrive in uncertainty, prefering projects others avoid, and I move fastâ€”often arriving with prototypes instead of just problems.

Whether leading teams or working hands-on, my focus stays the same: transforming frustration into satisfaction through thoughtful, high-impact design.'
